# Medical Question Intent Classification

A deep learning project that fine-tunes a DistilBERT transformer model to classify medical questions into intent categories. This system can help healthcare chatbots route questions appropriately and improve medical Q&A systems.

## 🎯 Overview

This project classifies medical questions into five categories:
- **Diagnosis**: Identifying conditions (e.g., "What could be causing my headache?")
- **Treatment**: Managing conditions (e.g., "What are treatment options for diabetes?")
- **Prevention**: Avoiding diseases (e.g., "How can I prevent asthma?")
- **Symptoms**: Recognizing signs (e.g., "What are symptoms of pneumonia?")
- **Medication**: Drug-related questions (e.g., "What are side effects of aspirin?")

## 🔧 Technologies

- **PyTorch** - Deep learning framework
- **Transformers (Hugging Face)** - Pre-trained language models
- **DistilBERT** - Efficient BERT variant for text classification
- **scikit-learn** - Evaluation metrics
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** - Visualization

## 📋 Installation

```bash
pip install torch transformers numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn tqdm
```

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
python medical_intent_classifier.py
```

The script will:
1. Generate synthetic medical Q&A dataset (1000 samples)
2. Fine-tune DistilBERT on classification task
3. Evaluate and display metrics
4. Generate visualizations
5. Save trained model to `saved_model/`

**Runtime:** 2-5 minutes on CPU, <1 minute on GPU

## 📊 Results

### Performance on Synthetic Data

**Accuracy:** 100% (200/200 test samples correct)

| Intent      | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Support |
|-------------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| Diagnosis   | 1.00      | 1.00   | 1.00     | 40      |
| Treatment   | 1.00      | 1.00   | 1.00     | 40      |
| Prevention  | 1.00      | 1.00   | 40       | 40      |
| Symptoms    | 1.00      | 1.00   | 1.00     | 40      |
| Medication  | 1.00      | 1.00   | 1.00     | 40      |

**Training Loss:** Decreased from 1.31 → 0.13 over 3 epochs

### Understanding the Results

The perfect accuracy on synthetic data demonstrates:
- ✅ Correct model architecture and implementation
- ✅ Effective training pipeline with proper optimization
- ✅ Model's ability to learn distinct linguistic patterns

**Expected Real-World Performance:** 75-85% accuracy

Real medical questions would be more challenging due to:
- Ambiguous questions with multiple intents
- Informal language, typos, and grammatical errors
- Complex medical terminology
- Questions that don't fit neatly into one category

### Example Predictions

```
Q: "What medications are available for treating diabetes?"
Predicted: medication ✓

Q: "How can I prevent heart disease?"
Predicted: prevention ✓

Q: "What are the symptoms of pneumonia?"
Predicted: symptoms ✓
```

## 🧠 Methodology

**Model:** DistilBERT (40% smaller than BERT, 95% performance)

**Training:**
- Optimizer: AdamW (lr=2e-5)
- Batch size: 16
- Epochs: 3
- Scheduler: Linear warmup

**Data Split:** 80% train, 20% test (stratified)

## 🔄 Using Real Data

To adapt for real medical questions:

1. Replace synthetic data generation:
```python
df = pd.read_csv('medical_questions.csv')
```

2. Ensure CSV has columns: `question` and `intent`

3. Adjust `INTENT_LABELS` dictionary if needed
